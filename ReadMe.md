PCF - Point Cloud Fit, is a robust automatic detection scheme for geometric primitives such as planes, cylinders and cuboids.

In this scheme, cylinders are first detected in iteration of energy-based geometric model fitting (by [GCO](http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/)) and cylinder parameter estimation (by [GTEngine](https://www.geometrictools.com/Downloads/Downloads.html)). Planes are then detected by Hough transform, and further described as bounded patches with their minimum bounding rectangles. Cuboids are finally detected with pair-wise geometry relations from the detected patches. After successively detection of cylinders, planar patches and cuboids, a mid-level geometry representation can be delivered.

> The detection results can be observed by rendering in 3D model view tool [PlyWin](https://github.com/weiquanmao/PlyWin).

## Projects

+ Obj2Ply : sampling the mesh model data (`*.obj`) into point cloud model data (`*.ply`).

+ PCE : the robust automatic detection scheme. This scheme takes the point cloud model `*.ply` as input and finally output the `*.strcut` file in which the detected components are recorded.

+ Struct2Ply : sampling the the detected components (`*.strcut`) into point cloud model data (`*.ply`).


The accuracy and completeness estimations for 3D reconstruction can be utilized here to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the detection results. Project **Struct2Ply** can offer you a convenience to convert the detection results into point cloud models, and the accuracy, completeness and F-score can then be estimated with [PCE](https://github.com/weiquanmao/PCE).

## Dependencies

+ [Qt](www.qt.io/download/)
+ [VCG Library](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/vcglib/) (Embedded)
+ [GCO](http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/) (Embedded)
+ [GTEngine](https://www.geometrictools.com/Downloads/Downloads.html) (Embedded)

## Building

1. First prepare Qt - [Qt Installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) - Select Qt 5.15.2 MSVC2019 under components
2. Search for 'Edit the system environment variables' and add a User variable QTDIR which equals to the installed folder and the MSVC toolchain, eg: `C:\Qt\5.15.2\msvc2019_64`
3. Open PCF.sln with Visual Studio
4. Build solution

Tested with Visual Studio 2022
